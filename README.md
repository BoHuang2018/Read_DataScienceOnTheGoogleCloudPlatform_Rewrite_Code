***What Is This Repository for ?***

This repository is my reading notes of the book by Valliappa Lakshmanan, _Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform_(2018).

This is a book showing a complete work flow of data science, step by step, with the advantage of GCP. I grained much by reading this book and handing-on its code.

Of course, the book has its own github repository, https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/data-science-on-gcp .

When I went through and ran the code on my personal Mac and GCP-project, I got stuck here and there. Yes, I tackled all the problems with the help of GCP documents and Stackoverflow. 

To have a better understanding of the content of the content, and a solid reference based on this book's code. I motivated myself to rewrite/reorganize the code in the clean code style, introduced by the book, _Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_, of Robert C. Martin.

I cannot say that my code is so clean as the book showed. But I spend much effort to follow the following three principles.
